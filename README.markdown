transformers-compat
===================

[![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/transformers-compat.svg)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/transformers-compat) [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/ekmett/transformers-compat.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/ekmett/transformers-compat

This provides a thin compatibility shim on top of transformers-0.2 to add the types that were added in transformers-0.3.

This enables users to maintain haskell-platform compatibility, while still gaining access ot the new functionality.
