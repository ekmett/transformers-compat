transformers-compat
===================

[![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/hackage/v/transformers-compat.svg)](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/transformers-compat) [![Build Status](https://github.com/ekmett/transformers-compat/workflows/Haskell-CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ekmett/transformers-compat/actions?query=workflow%3AHaskell-CI)

This provides a thin compatibility shim on top of transformers-0.2 to add the types that were added in transformers-0.3.

This enables users to maintain haskell-platform compatibility, while still gaining access ot the new functionality.

Related packages
----------------
The `writer-cps-transformers` package backports the
`Control.Monad.Trans.{RWS,Writer}.CPS` modules that were introduced in
`transformers-0.5.6.0`. There are also a variety of companion packages which
backport orphan instances for these types. One example is `writer-cps-mtl`,
which backports instances of type classes from the `mtl` library.
